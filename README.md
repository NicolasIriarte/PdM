# Introduction

This repository will be used for the course "Microprocessor Programming" (PdM from now on, due to its acronym in Spanish).

It will be used for the development of various practical tasks assigned in the subject, likewise it will be used to house the code made for the final project of the subject.

# Use

The subject mandatory requires the use of the Stm32Cube IDE, so all projects will be eclipse projects for said IDE.
